# Projects

----

This project explicitly encourages the iterative nature of research as a series of questions and answers that gradually refine your hypotheses. I'm hoping that you work together with a group of 2-3 classmates that share a broad research interests (neurons, fMRI, ECoG, theory and behavior). 

Once you’re in groups, you will start brainstorming and searching the literature for interesting papers, with the goal of forming a project question. For the first month of class, you will try preliminary analyses of the datasets with the goal of refining and informing your question. During this time we will cover, as a class, the general strategy for approaching projects (the “10 steps”). You will apply this strategy to your own question. This will culminate on a group presentation sharing the background research and any preliminary analyses you've performed.  You should aim to have ~15 minutes prepared for this.  

For the rest of the second month you will continue to analyze data/refine your question, with the goal of writing an abstract and presenting your progress. Your abstract may or may not include results, but it should at least include a testable hypothesis. For the rest of the course, you will focus on getting evidence for/against your hypothesis.  You'll present your work in a status-check presentation and you should aim to have ~10 minutes prepared for this.  

You'll work to try to refine your analyses and write up your results.  Your written report should be in an academic article format (abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion).  Your written reports can be collaborative, but you will turn in individual reports to me.  All of this work will culminate in a project presentation.  Please plan to present ~20 minutes describing your hypotheses, your analyses, and any further discussion.  Depending on the number of groups, these presentations will be randomly assigned over the course of 2 days during the last week of classes.
